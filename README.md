# super-league-scorigami
My own attempt at a Super League (rugby league) scorigami, inspired by Jon Bois' version for the NFL, and using data collected by the Rugby League project (I intend to use a web scraper)

Phase 1 (to get a table of scores by winner vs loser) was done a while ago - will update the readme.md in due course.

Teaser: only once (in 2000) has a team scored just 1 point all match - Salford 1-52 Bradford (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_league/715918.stm)
